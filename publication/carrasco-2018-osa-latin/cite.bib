 abstract = {We introduce the online Set Aggregation Problem, which is a natural generalization of the Multi-Level Aggregation Problem, which in turn generalizes the TCP Acknowledgment Problem and the Joint Replenishment Problem. We give a deterministic online algorithm, and show that its competitive ratio is logarithmic in the number of requests. We also give a matching lower bound on the competitive ratio of any randomized online algorithm.},

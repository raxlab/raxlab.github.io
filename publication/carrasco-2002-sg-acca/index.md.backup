abstract: "This work presents a new guidance system for a two independent wheeled mobile robot, based on fuzzy logic, which offers several advantages over the most known controllers. Two control problems will be analyzed: moving the robot from one point to another, and making the robot chase a mobile reference. First, using the open-loop model of the robot, the design parameters will be determined. Then, a PID controller will be presented, which will be used for comparison with three fuzzy controllers: a fuzzy PI Mamdani type controller, a Takagi – Sugeno type one, and one based on heuristic rules."

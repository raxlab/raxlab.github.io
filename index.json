The reforms established a maximum waiting time between diagnosis and treatment for a set of diseases, described as an opportunity guarantee within the reform. If the maximum waiting time is exceeded, the patient is referred to another (private) facility and receives a voucher to cover the additional expenses. This voucher is paid by the health provider that had to do the procedure, which generally is a public hospital. In general, this reform has improved the service for patients with GES pathologies at the expense of patients with non-GES pathologies. These new conditions create a complicated planning scenario for hospitals, in which the hospital's OR Manager must balance the fulfillment of these opportunity guarantees and the timely service of patients not covered by the guarantee. With the collaboration of the Instituto de Neurocirugía, in Santiago, Chile, we developed a mathematical model based on stochastic dynamic programming to schedule surgeries in order to minimize the cost of referrals to the private sector. Given the large size of the state space, we developed an heuristic to compute good solutions in reasonable time and analyzed its performance. Our experimental results, with both simulated and real data, show that our algorithm performs close to optimum and improves upon the current practice. When we compared the results of our heuristic against those obtained by the hospital's OR manager in a simulation setting with real data, we reduced the overtime from occurring 21% of the time to zero, and the non-GES average waiting list's length from 71 to 58 patients, without worsening the average throughput.","tags":["hospital management","operating room scheduling","scheduling"],"title":"Operating room scheduling under waiting time constraints: the Chilean GES plan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Javiera Barrera","Rodrigo A.

This statement is especially true for the production of commodities, where transportation represents a central element for operational continuity. Additionally, in many industries, and in particular those with hazardous environments, fleet control must satisfy a wide range of security restrictions to ensure that risks are kept at bay and accidents are minimum. Furthermore, in these environments, any decision support tool must cope with noisy and incomplete data and give recommendations every few minutes. In this work, we present a fast and efficient decision support tool to help fleet managers oversee and control ore trucks in a mining setting. The main objective of our system is to help managers avoid collisions between ore trucks and personnel buses, one of the most critical security constraints in our case study, keeping a minimum security-distance between the two at all times. Furthermore, we develop and implement additional algorithms so that our approach can work with real-life noisy GPS data. Through the use of historical data, we also study the performance of our decision support system, validating that it works under the real-life conditions presented by the company. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach improved truck and road utilization significantly, allowing the fleet manager to control the security distance required by their procedures.","tags":["control systems","fleet control","real-time control","vehicle routing"],"title":"Real-time fleet management decision support system with security constraints","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianluca Baselli","Felipe Contreras","Matías Lillo","Magdalena Marín","Rodrigo A.

Many different settings and specific constraints due to legal, environmental, and operational requirements have been modeled, improving the performance of the harvesting process significantly. During the summer of 2017, Chile suffered from the most massive wildfires in its history, affecting almost half a million hectares, of which nearly half were forests owned by medium and small forestry companies. Some of the stands were burned by intense crown fires, which always spread fast, that burned the foliage and outer layer of the bark but left standing dead trees that could be salvage harvested before insect and decay processes rendered them unusable for commercial purposes. Unlike the typical operational programming models studied in the past, in this setting, companies can make insurance claims on part or all of the burnt forest, whereas the rest of the forest needs to be harvested before it loses its value. This problem is known as the salvage logging problem. The issue also has an important social component when considering medium and small forestry and logging companies: most of their personnel come from local communities, which have already been affected by the fires. Harvesting part of the remaining forest can allow them to keep their jobs longer and, hopefully, leave the company in a better financial situation if the harvesting areas are correctly selected. In this work, we present a novel mixed-integer optimization-based approach to support salvage logging decisions, which helps in the configuration of operational-level harvesting and workforce assignment plan. Our model takes into account the payment from an insurance claim as well as future income from harvesting the remaining trees. The model also computes an optimal assignment of personnel to the different activities required. The objective is to improve the cash position of the company by the end of the harvest and ensure that the company is paying all its liabilities and maintaining personnel. We show how our model performs compared to the current decisions made by medium and small-sized forestry companies, and we study the specific case of a small forestry company located in Cauquenes, Chile, which used our model to decide its course of action.","tags":["forestry","operations research","resource allocation","resource management","scheduling"],"title":"Optimal decisions for salvage logging after wildfires","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A Carrasco","Ioannis Akrotirianakis","Amit Chakraborty"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b45aafc52550594756c090604fa55b0b","permalink":"https://www.raxlab.science/publication/carrasco-2014-eupatent-1/","publishdate":"2020-05-22T00:27:09.991313Z","relpermalink":"/publication/carrasco-2014-eupatent-1/","section":"publication","summary":"Method for controlling flow of energy in smart electrical power network, involves controlling energy consumption of user based on optimal load shedding profile, optimal billing structure, and optimal load shifting profile.","tags":["demand management","energy management","game theory"],"title":"Demand shaping in an electrical power grid","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A.

Our approach helps to build a program considering the operational-level harvesting schedule, workforce allocation, and financial actions that include the insurance claims. The objective is to improve the company's cash position by the end of the harvest, without reducing the workforce. We compare our model's performance with current decisions made by medium and small forestry companies and apply it to the specific case of a company located in Cauquenes, Chile.","tags":["forestry","operations research","resource allocation","resource management","scheduling"],"title":"Salvage logging: harvest scheduling and personnel assignment after wildfires","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A.

This work is an extension of the resource dependent job processing time problem and the energy aware scheduling problems. We develop a new constant factor approximation algorithm for resource cost aware scheduling problems: the objective is to minimize the sum of the total cost of resources and the total weighted completion time in the one machine non-preemptive setting, allowing for arbitrary precedence constraints and release dates. Our algorithm handles general job-dependent resource cost functions. We also analyze the practical performance of our algorithms, showing that it is significantly superior to the theoretical bounds and in fact it is very close to optimal. The analysis is done using simulations and real instances, which are left publicly available for future benchmarks.

This implies that any increment in their reliability will also improve their benefits. One way to achieve this is by adding redundant elements to the robot, but this adds complexity and cost to the design. On the other hand, cooperative mobile robots formed by members with the same basic structure provide a natural redundancy of elements, which may be used for reliability improvement. This work presents an architecture that takes advantage of the analytical and sensor redundancy present in groups of cooperative mobile robots in order to increase the reliability of the whole system. First, the design of the architecture is portrayed and the faults to be detected are described. The different layers of the system are then explained and analyzed using several simulations to test their capabilities and limitations. Finally, the experimental results on a group of small mobile robots are shown, validating the results delivered by simulations.

This thesis centers on the problem of failures on cooperative mobile robots, by designing a new low-cost architecture of fault detection and diagnosis, which is later implemented. This system allows both the control structure and the operators of the robot, to take into account the actual operating state of the mobile robot, by giving more information to them. The architecture is first evaluated using a simulation platform in MATLAB, which also helps to analyze the performance of the system.

Since 2021, I\u0026rsquo;m also a member of the Advisory Board of the  Columbia Global Center | Santiago and a Board Member of the  Chilean Institute of Operational Research. I hold a B.S. in Electrical \u0026amp; Industrial Engineering and an M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; and a Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research from Columbia University.\nMy research interests are in combinatorial problems, particularly scheduling problems, and the analysis and design of approximation algorithms. In addition, I\u0026rsquo;m currently interested in control and energy/power management applications and dealing with uncertainty in these settings. To do so, with our research team, we are combining techniques from combinatorial optimization with uncertainty modeling and stochastic optimization, developing robust decision support tools for applied problems.\nAt UAI, I founded and was the initial director of the UAI Systems Center; a center focused on solving complex real-life problems using operations research tools.

Prognostics are performed to estimate the system or subsystem’s remaining useful life (RUL). This estimation can be used as a supply in decision-making within maintenance plans and procedures. This work focuses on prognostics by developing a recurrent neural network and a forecasting method called Prophet to measure the performance quality in RUL estimation.

Thanks to the increasing data availability, decision-makers can now use models to better estimate, evaluate, and achieve this balance. This work presents a maintenance scheduling model which considers prognostic information provided by a predictive system. In particular, we developed a prescriptive maintenance system based on run-to-failure signal segmentation and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The LSTM network returns the prediction of the remaining useful life when a fault is present in a component. We incorporate such predictions and their inherent errors in a decision support system based on a stochastic optimization model, incorporating them via chance constraints. These constraints control the number of failed components and consider the physical distance between them to reduce sparsity and minimize the total maintenance cost. We show that this approach can compute solutions for relatively large instances in reasonable computational time through experimental results. Furthermore, the decision-maker can identify the correct operating point depending on the balance between costs and failure probability.","tags":["prescriptive maintenance","observatory operations","predictive maintenance"],"title":"Improving prescriptive maintenance by incorporating post-prognostic information through chance constraints","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A.

Because of its importance, the operating room scheduling problem has been addressed from many different perspectives since the early 1960s. One of the main difficulties that has reduced the applicability of the current results is the high variability in surgery duration, making schedule recommendations hard to implement.\nIn this work, we propose a time-indexed scheduling formulation to solve the operational problem. Our main contribution is that we propose the use of chance constraints related to the surgery duration’s probability distribution for each surgeon to improve the scheduling performance. We show how to implement these chance constraints as linear ones in our time-indexed formulation, enhancing the performance of the resulting schedules significantly.\nThrough data analysis of real historical instances, we develop specific constraints that improve the schedule, reducing the need for overtime without affecting the utilization significantly. Furthermore, these constraints give the operating room manager the possibility of balancing overtime and utilization through a tunning parameter in our formulation. Finally, through simulations and the use of real instances, we report the performance for four different metrics, showing the importance of using historical data to get the right balance between the utilization and overtime.","tags":["operating room scheduling","Scheduling under uncertainty","scheduling"],"title":"Dealing with Uncertain Surgery Times in Operating Room Scheduling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A.

Although it is a central task in an observatory’s operation, which affects the utilization and throughput of observations, extensive manual intervention is still required in almost all observatories. Little resources have been invested in optimizing the scheduling’s efficiency, which, in the case of large-scale observatories like ALMA or VLT, might result in significant cost-effective improvements. This issue gains importance since observatory operations have increased in complexity, with plenty of sources of uncertainty.\nThis issue has a lot in common with problems typically found in other industries. Here, operations research tools have been used to develop solutions for many related problems: from scheduling production plans to routing delivery vehicles. These tools and methodologies have been a source of efficiency, allowing organizations to do more with limited resources.\nThe objective of this project is to connect these two worlds, kickstarting and fostering interdisciplinary research between operations research and astronomy operations, by tackling one of the most relevant problems: optimal scheduling of operations. The focus will be to develop and apply operations research tools to construct decision support systems that can help managers improve efficiency and utilization.\nThis project is funded by grant ASTRO20-0058 from ANID and by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Radio Telescope.\nProject Team:\n Lead Researcher: Rodrigo A.

Due to the climate and sky requirements, these high-precision instruments are generally located in remote areas, suffering from the harsh environments around it. These modern telescopes not only produce massive amounts of scientific data, but they also generate an enormous amount of operational information. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is one of these unique instruments, generating more than 50 Gb of operational data every day while functioning in conditions of extreme dryness and altitude. To maintain the array working under extreme conditions, the engineering teams must check over 130,000 monitoring points, combing through the massive datasets produced every day. To make this possible, predictive tools are needed to identify, hopefully beforehand, the occurrence of failures in all the different subsystems. This work presents a novel fault detection scheme for one of these subsystems, the Intermediate Frequency Processors (IFP). This subsystem is critical to process the information gathered by each antenna and communicate it, reliably, to the correlator for processing. Our approach is based on echo state networks, a configuration of artificial neural networks, used to learn and predict the signal patterns. These patterns are later compared to the actual signal, to identify failure modes. Additional preprocessing techniques were also added since the signal-to-noise ratio of the data used was very low. The proposed scheme was tested in over seven years of data from 132 IFPs at ALMA, showing an accuracy of over 70%. Furthermore, the detection was done several months earlier, on average, when compared to what human operators did. These results help the maintenance procedures, increasing reliability while reducing humans' exposure to the harsh environment where the antennas are. Although applied to a specific fault, this technique is broad enough to be applied to other types of faults and settings.","tags":["fault detection","fault diagnosis","observatory operations","predictive maintenance"],"title":"Slow Degradation Fault Detection in a Harsh Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianluca Baselli","Felipe Contreras","Matías Lillo","Magdalena Marín","Rodrigo A.

Many different settings and specific constraints due to legal, environmental, and operational requirements have been modeled, improving the performance of the harvesting process significantly. During the summer of 2017, Chile suffered from the most massive wildfires in its history, affecting almost half a million hectares, of which nearly half were forests owned by medium and small forestry companies. Some of the stands were burned by intense crown fires, which always spread fast, that burned the foliage and outer layer of the bark but left standing dead trees that could be salvage harvested before insect and decay processes rendered them unusable for commercial purposes. Unlike the typical operational programming models studied in the past, in this setting, companies can make insurance claims on part or all of the burnt forest, whereas the rest of the forest needs to be harvested before it loses its value. This problem is known as the salvage logging problem. The issue also has an important social component when considering medium and small forestry and logging companies: most of their personnel come from local communities, which have already been affected by the fires. Harvesting part of the remaining forest can allow them to keep their jobs longer and, hopefully, leave the company in a better financial situation if the harvesting areas are correctly selected. In this work, we present a novel mixed-integer optimization-based approach to support salvage logging decisions, which helps in the configuration of operational-level harvesting and workforce assignment plan. Our model takes into account the payment from an insurance claim as well as future income from harvesting the remaining trees. The model also computes an optimal assignment of personnel to the different activities required. The objective is to improve the cash position of the company by the end of the harvest and ensure that the company is paying all its liabilities and maintaining personnel. We show how our model performs compared to the current decisions made by medium and small-sized forestry companies, and we study the specific case of a small forestry company located in Cauquenes, Chile, which used our model to decide its course of action.","tags":["forestry","operations research","resource allocation","resource management","scheduling"],"title":"Optimal decisions for salvage logging after wildfires","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A.

If no storage is available, the decision is simple: if generation is larger than our demand, we sell to the grid. Otherwise, we need to buy from the grid. When storage is present, the decision is not as straightforward. Should we store the energy for future usage? Or maybe tomorrow we will have a large surplus of energy that allows us to use the energy today, at a time when the price is high. When is the best time to sell, store or use solar energy?

Furthermore, in these environments, any decision support tool must cope with noisy and incomplete data and give recommendations every few minutes. In this work, we present a fast and efficient decision support tool to help fleet managers oversee and control ore trucks in a mining setting. The main objective of our system is to help managers avoid collisions between ore trucks and personnel buses, one of the most critical security constraints in our case study, keeping a minimum security-distance between the two at all times. Furthermore, we develop and implement additional algorithms so that our approach can work with real-life noisy GPS data. Through the use of historical data, we also study the performance of our decision support system, validating that it works under the real-life conditions presented by the company.

In general, this reform has improved the service for patients with GES pathologies at the expense of patients with non-GES pathologies. These new conditions create a complicated planning scenario for hospitals, in which the hospital's OR Manager must balance the fulfillment of these opportunity guarantees and the timely service of patients not covered by the guarantee. With the collaboration of the Instituto de Neurocirugía, in Santiago, Chile, we developed a mathematical model based on stochastic dynamic programming to schedule surgeries in order to minimize the cost of referrals to the private sector. Given the large size of the state space, we developed an heuristic to compute good solutions in reasonable time and analyzed its performance. Our experimental results, with both simulated and real data, show that our algorithm performs close to optimum and improves upon the current practice. When we compared the results of our heuristic against those obtained by the hospital's OR manager in a simulation setting with real data, we reduced the overtime from occurring 21% of the time to zero, and the non-GES average waiting list's length from 71 to 58 patients, without worsening the average throughput.","tags":["hospital management","operating room scheduling","scheduling"],"title":"Operating room scheduling under waiting time constraints: the Chilean GES plan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony D.

However, when the complexity scale of the observatories increases, along with the construction and operational costs, the scheduling optimization becomes a key subject. Experience has shown that small optimization improvements translate into a significant efficiency gain, measured by an increase in the scientific return and diminishing operational costs. When entering an era of big ground based observatories the scheduling problem becomes essential. The scheduling optimization requires a multidisciplinary approach involving the fields of engineering, computer science, data analysis, operations research, and mathematical modeling. It is studied from both a methodological standpoint as well as its applications in different fields and industries. Due to such multidisciplinarity, ADASS is an excellent meeting and exchange point to gather the different communities working on the optimization problem, with a special focus on astronomical scheduling. This 'Birds of a Feather' session focused on the scheduling problem definition and solution approaches. The discussion is timely since we are at a point where instruments like ALMA (in the ADASS host country) recently started steady state operations while other big observatories such as SKA or CTA or LSST are currently at designing stage, and are actively developing new optimal scheduling systems. The aim of this meeting was to promote the building of a collaboration network between groups in different projects and disciplines in order to make the most out of the synergies among them. Such network will lead to the creation of joint research opportunities and efforts.","tags":["observatory operations","scheduling"],"title":"Astronomical Scheduling in the Era of Big Observatories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A Carrasco","Ioannis Akrotirianakis","Amit Chakraborty"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b45aafc52550594756c090604fa55b0b","permalink":"https://www.raxlab.science/publication/carrasco-2014-eupatent-1/","publishdate":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/carrasco-2014-eupatent-1/","section":"publication","summary":"Method for controlling flow of energy in smart electrical power network, involves controlling energy consumption of user based on optimal load shedding profile, optimal billing structure, and optimal load shifting profile.","tags":["demand management","energy management","game theory"],"title":"Demand shaping in an electrical power grid","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianluca Baselli","Felipe Contreras","Matías Lillo","Magdalena Marín","Rodrigo A.

In most cases, fires consumed only the tree's bark, leaving the rest of the tree with some commercial value that could be captured. The problem of deciding what actions to take with the remaining forest in this setting is known as the salvage logging problem. In this work, we present a novel mixed-integer optimization model, that can help small and medium-sized forestries make better decisions in this setting, at an operational level. Our approach helps to build a program considering the operational-level harvesting schedule, workforce allocation, and financial actions that include the insurance claims. The objective is to improve the company's cash position by the end of the harvest, without reducing the workforce. We compare our model's performance with current decisions made by medium and small forestry companies and apply it to the specific case of a company located in Cauquenes, Chile.","tags":["forestry","operations research","resource allocation","resource management","scheduling"],"title":"Salvage logging: harvest scheduling and personnel assignment after wildfires","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A.

This implies that any increment in their reliability will also improve their benefits. One way to achieve this is by adding redundant elements to the robot, but this adds complexity and cost to the design. On the other hand, cooperative mobile robots formed by members with the same basic structure provide a natural redundancy of elements, which may be used for reliability improvement. This work presents an architecture that takes advantage of the analytical and sensor redundancy present in groups of cooperative mobile robots in order to increase the reliability of the whole system. First, the design of the architecture is portrayed and the faults to be detected are described. The different layers of the system are then explained and analyzed using several simulations to test their capabilities and limitations. Finally, the experimental results on a group of small mobile robots are shown, validating the results delivered by simulations. These results show that the proposed architecture is able to detect and isolate correctly most of the faults tested.","tags":["control systems","fault detection","fault diagnosis","fuzzy logic","mobile robots","robotics","signal processing"],"title":"Fault detection and isolation in cooperative mobile robots using multilayer architecture and dynamic observers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A.

Due to the benefits that these systems bring and the complexity of the environments where they are used, it is necessary to improve their reliability, which can be done by adding fault detection systems that are capable of diagnosing the operating state of the robot and react according to it. This thesis centers on the problem of failures on cooperative mobile robots, by designing a new low-cost architecture of fault detection and diagnosis, which is later implemented. This system allows both the control structure and the operators of the robot, to take into account the actual operating state of the mobile robot, by giving more information to them. The architecture is first evaluated using a simulation platform in MATLAB, which also helps to analyze the performance of the system. Then, the fault detection and diagnosis system is implemented on a cooperative group of small and resource-limited mobile robots, showing an excellent performance in the identification of the different faults.","tags":["control systems","fault detection","fault diagnosis","mobile robots","robotics"],"title":"Detección y diagnóstico de fallas en robots móviles cooperativos","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A.

Manual inspection of these logs is impractical, needing automated methods capable of accurate and scalable anomaly detection. This paper proposes a novel sentiment-aware anomaly detection framework, leveraging Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers with In-Task Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning (BERT-ITPT-FiT), to classify textual logs based on their inherent sentiment polarity. Specifically tailored for the Paranal Observatory, our approach incorporates a computationally efficient, character-based preprocessing strategy that retains essential semantic elements, such as acronyms and technical terms, thereby eliminating the need for traditional parsing. This method efficiently processes a substantial dataset comprising 7,359,506 log entries from three VLTI instruments in an average runtime of only 114.23 seconds. Extensive experiments utilizing real operational data demonstrate that our architecture achieves an effective throughput of approximately 3,958 logs per second during the combined embedding generation and model training phases while consistently delivering an excellent classification performance. Besides, it significantly outperforms existing deep learning methods combined with conventional embeddings in both in-and cross-instrument scenarios, achieving F1-Scores exceeding 99.99% and 99.96%, respectively. This work emphasizes a critical balance between computational efficiency and classification performance, providing a robust and scalable solution for anomaly detection in high-stakes observatory operations.","tags":["prescriptive maintenance","observatory operations","predictive maintenance"],"title":"A Fine-Tuned BERT-Based Model for Individual Log Anomaly Detection in Operational Monitoring at Paranal Observatory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A.

Efficient scheduling of ALMA’s data processing tasks, especially those involving complex pipeline executions, is crucial for maximizing operational productivity. This paper addresses the challenge by developing a predictive model that estimates the runtime of these tasks, enabling more effective scheduling and resource management. Our approach employs the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) and Quantile Forest models to predict processing times and quantify uncertainties. The use of these models is innovative, as it not only provides accurate predictions but also offers insights into the variability of processing times. This is particularly beneficial for handling the dynamic nature of the data processing workload at ALMA. We enhance the model’s performance and reliability by incorporating variable scaling and logarithmic transformations. To determine the best model, we comprehensively evaluated seven different machine-learning techniques. Our results show that the LGBM model and quantile estimation outperform traditional methods in predicting task durations. This leads to more efficient scheduling, as it allows the system to account for potential delays and optimize the sequencing of jobs. The quantile approach, in particular, offers a robust method for dealing with the inherent uncertainty in processing times. Our predictive tool has demonstrated a substantial reduction in overall flow time, decreasing it by 5.7%. Further improvements were achieved using stochastic scheduling techniques, which leverage the uncertainty estimates provided by our model. This research highlights the potential of machine learning to significantly enhance the operational efficiency of large-scale observatories like ALMA, providing a scalable and practical solution for managing complex data processing tasks.","tags":["observatory operations","predictive analytics","scheduling"],"title":"Uncertainty estimation through quantile forest for prescriptive scheduling of data processing at ALMA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A.

However, separating forest disturbance causes in change-detection pipelines is challenging due to the complex interplay of multiple drivers affecting vegetation. This study aims to detect deforestation in highly heterogeneous ecosystems. We used Landsat NDVI time-series data for testing three unsupervised change detection methods: 1) the non-parametric phenological anomaly detection (npphen), 2) the continuous change detection and classification (CCDC), and 3) the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithms. We used visual interpretation of Google Earth Pro high-resolution data (10 m) to depict deforestation, and natural-induced changes, like forest browning and fires, evaluating the performance of the unsupervised methods. Additionally, a Random Forest model trained with the outputs from detection algorithms together with elevation and radar vegetation index data were utilised to depict deforestation in a second step. While PELT slightly outperformed other methods for tracking general vegetation changes, with overall accuracies (OA) ranging from 0.78 to 0.99, depending on the vegetation type, it also showed the slowest deforestation tracking response. CCDC presented the fastest response and an OA between 0.78 and 0.95. Additionally, we observed a mean OA of only 0.47 when separating deforestation from other changes using only the unsupervised models. On the other hand, deforestation was accurately detected (OA = 0.93; kappa = 0.83) when using CCDC outputs within a secondary supervised classification, agreeing with selected citizen-based complaints from the Environmental Superintendence. The relatively fast response in deforestation tracking using CCDC makes it a viable alternative for near real-time monitoring. Commonly used unsupervised detection methods may be coupled with supervised techniques to depict vegetation change sources robustly. This application constitutes a step forward for managing and monitoring vegetation areas in highly complex and dynamic landscapes, like Mediterranean ecosystems.","tags":["Remote Sensing","Machine Learning","Deforestation"],"title":"Is the change deforestation?

Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality in Chile, and the existing lack of standardized prioritization criteria has led to extensive and uneven waiting lists, particularly impacting disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. By enhancing the way oncology patients are prioritized for systemic therapies, such as chemotherapy, this project seeks to improve equity and efficiency within the public health system.\nOur approach leverages data science and mathematical optimization to develop robust models for managing these waiting lists.

Managing these constraints effectively can lead to substantial performance improvements but requires advanced techniques to weigh the trade-off between consuming resources and meeting scheduling demands. In many cases, resources, such as energy or workforce, are not only limited but also costly, adding an extra layer of complexity to scheduling tasks optimally.\nA unique aspect of this research is its focus on scheduling under uncertainty, where key parameters, like job sizes or deadlines, may not be known beforehand. This complexity is particularly relevant to observatories in Chile, where variable factors such as sky quality or observation lengths affect task durations. Through collaboration with some of the largest observatories, we gain access to unique datasets and domain expertise, enabling us to test our methods in real-world scenarios. This approach also opens pathways to apply our findings in other industries that face similar scheduling and resource challenges.\nWe are developing a comprehensive set of prescriptive analytics tools, including new algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees and benchmarks that address these resource-cost-aware scheduling problems. Our work will involve constructing approximation algorithms using mathematical programming and resource augmentation techniques.

Thanks to the increasing data availability, decision-makers can now use models to better estimate, evaluate, and achieve this balance. This work presents a maintenance scheduling model which considers prognostic information provided by a predictive system. In particular, we developed a prescriptive maintenance system based on run-to-failure signal segmentation and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The LSTM network returns the prediction of the remaining useful life when a fault is present in a component. We incorporate such predictions and their inherent errors in a decision support system based on a stochastic optimization model, incorporating them via chance constraints. These constraints control the number of failed components and consider the physical distance between them to reduce sparsity and minimize the total maintenance cost. We show that this approach can compute solutions for relatively large instances in reasonable computational time through experimental results.

One of the main difficulties that has reduced the applicability of the current results is the high variability in surgery duration, making schedule recommendations hard to implement.\nIn this work, we propose a time-indexed scheduling formulation to solve the operational problem. Our main contribution is that we propose the use of chance constraints related to the surgery duration’s probability distribution for each surgeon to improve the scheduling performance. We show how to implement these chance constraints as linear ones in our time-indexed formulation, enhancing the performance of the resulting schedules significantly.\nThrough data analysis of real historical instances, we develop specific constraints that improve the schedule, reducing the need for overtime without affecting the utilization significantly. Furthermore, these constraints give the operating room manager the possibility of balancing overtime and utilization through a tunning parameter in our formulation. Finally, through simulations and the use of real instances, we report the performance for four different metrics, showing the importance of using historical data to get the right balance between the utilization and overtime.","tags":["operating room scheduling","Scheduling under uncertainty","scheduling"],"title":"Dealing with Uncertain Surgery Times in Operating Room Scheduling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A.

By using photographs of the Moon taken with a smartphone through a simple telescope, we were able to introduce these concepts to high-school students and college newcomers. By recognizing different Moon geological structures within the photograph, we teach students how to calculate distances of mountain ranges or areas of craters on the Moon's surface, introducing the notions of geodesics and spherical triangles. Furthermore, students can empirically see that the correct estimations for the actual values cannot be obtained using flat geometry. Instead, by using three-dimensional curved geometry, precise estimates of lengths and areas of geological elements in the Moon can be computed with less than 4% error. These procedures help students understand, concretely, non-Euclidean geometry concepts.","tags":["astronomy","education"],"title":"Using smartphone photographs of the Moon to acquaint students with non-Euclidean geometry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A.

Although it is a central task in an observatory’s operation, which affects the utilization and throughput of observations, extensive manual intervention is still required in almost all observatories. Moreover, little resources have been invested in optimizing the scheduling’s efficiency, which, in the case of large-scale observatories like ALMA or VLT, might result in significant cost-effective improvements. This issue gains importance since observatory operations have increased in complexity, with plenty of sources of uncertainty.\nThis issue has a lot in common with problems typically found in other industries. Operations research tools have been used here to develop solutions for many related topics, from scheduling production plans to routing delivery vehicles. These tools and methodologies have been a source of efficiency, allowing organizations to do more with limited resources.\nThis project aims to connect these two worlds, kickstarting and fostering interdisciplinary research between operations research and astronomy operations by tackling one of the most relevant problems: optimal operations scheduling. The focus will be to develop and apply operations research tools to construct decision support systems that can help managers improve efficiency and utilization.\nThis project is funded by grant ASTRO20-0058 from ANID and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Radio Telescope.\nProject Team:\n Lead Researcher: Rodrigo A.

Despite the above, the study of this problem is still very nascent in South America, where most of the methods proposed in the literature correspond to process-based dynamic models and classical statistical methods. Increasing the accuracy of predicting the probability of occurrence of extreme temperatures at the seasonal scale would have huge impacts on our economic life (food production, energy consumption), health, etc.\nInnovative approaches are emerging in climate forecasting, using network science and machine learning methodologies. The complex interrelations between temporal and spatial variables in climate time series justify the use of climate networks as an underlying automatic model explanation of the complex physical processes involved. The use of machine learning methods, particularly deep learning architectures, is justified by their success in several forecasting problems.\nIn this project, we will evaluate the precision of the most prominent deep-learning architectures for our forecasting problem, particularly those implementing spatiotemporal models based on graphs (climate networks). The most promising antecedents for this methodology are several works based on climate networks and the effect of “El Niño” on similar forecasting problems. We expect to propose improvements to these deep learning architectures to increase their precision in our particular problems. For example, changing the scale of nodes, changing the similarity of edges, proposing new architectures that include multiple networks, training the model with augmented data, etc. We will implement and compare the results with classical statistical methods, such as principal component regression technique and Wavelet transform-based methods, among others. Assuming we achieve good predictive quality, we will evaluate the impact of these predictions on some human activities. We will focus on risk analysis of specific infrastructures (telecommunication networks, energy distribution) and on concrete case studies in situations where the considered extreme events have a strong negative impact and for which historical data are available.\nThis project is funded by grant 22-CLIMAT-02 (AMSUD210012) from ANID.\nProject Team:\n International Project Coordinator: Pablo Rodríguez Bocca, Universidad de la República, Uruguay Country Coordinator (Chile): Rodrigo A.

Due to the climate and sky requirements, these high-precision instruments are generally located in remote areas, suffering from the harsh environments around it. These modern telescopes not only produce massive amounts of scientific data, but they also generate an enormous amount of operational information. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is one of these unique instruments, generating more than 50 Gb of operational data every day while functioning in conditions of extreme dryness and altitude. To maintain the array working under extreme conditions, the engineering teams must check over 130,000 monitoring points, combing through the massive datasets produced every day. To make this possible, predictive tools are needed to identify, hopefully beforehand, the occurrence of failures in all the different subsystems. This work presents a novel fault detection scheme for one of these subsystems, the Intermediate Frequency Processors (IFP). This subsystem is critical to process the information gathered by each antenna and communicate it, reliably, to the correlator for processing. Our approach is based on echo state networks, a configuration of artificial neural networks, used to learn and predict the signal patterns. These patterns are later compared to the actual signal, to identify failure modes. Additional preprocessing techniques were also added since the signal-to-noise ratio of the data used was very low. The proposed scheme was tested in over seven years of data from 132 IFPs at ALMA, showing an accuracy of over 70%. Furthermore, the detection was done several months earlier, on average, when compared to what human operators did. These results help the maintenance procedures, increasing reliability while reducing humans' exposure to the harsh environment where the antennas are. Although applied to a specific fault, this technique is broad enough to be applied to other types of faults and settings.","tags":["fault detection","fault diagnosis","observatory operations","predictive maintenance"],"title":"Slow Degradation Fault Detection in a Harsh Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianluca Baselli","Felipe Contreras","Matías Lillo","Magdalena Marín","Rodrigo A.

Many different settings and specific constraints due to legal, environmental, and operational requirements have been modeled, improving the performance of the harvesting process significantly. During the summer of 2017, Chile suffered from the most massive wildfires in its history, affecting almost half a million hectares, of which nearly half were forests owned by medium and small forestry companies. Some of the stands were burned by intense crown fires, which always spread fast, that burned the foliage and outer layer of the bark but left standing dead trees that could be salvage harvested before insect and decay processes rendered them unusable for commercial purposes. Unlike the typical operational programming models studied in the past, in this setting, companies can make insurance claims on part or all of the burnt forest, whereas the rest of the forest needs to be harvested before it loses its value. This problem is known as the salvage logging problem. The issue also has an important social component when considering medium and small forestry and logging companies: most of their personnel come from local communities, which have already been affected by the fires. Harvesting part of the remaining forest can allow them to keep their jobs longer and, hopefully, leave the company in a better financial situation if the harvesting areas are correctly selected. In this work, we present a novel mixed-integer optimization-based approach to support salvage logging decisions, which helps in the configuration of operational-level harvesting and workforce assignment plan. Our model takes into account the payment from an insurance claim as well as future income from harvesting the remaining trees. The model also computes an optimal assignment of personnel to the different activities required. The objective is to improve the cash position of the company by the end of the harvest and ensure that the company is paying all its liabilities and maintaining personnel. We show how our model performs compared to the current decisions made by medium and small-sized forestry companies, and we study the specific case of a small forestry company located in Cauquenes, Chile, which used our model to decide its course of action.","tags":["forestry","operations research","resource allocation","resource management","scheduling"],"title":"Optimal decisions for salvage logging after wildfires","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A.

In particular, our focus is on building decision support tools for optimal storage management when a variable and intermittent energy source is used.\nThis project combines machine learning methodologies and stochastic optimization tools to develop optimal energy management systems for a system with photovoltaic generation, interconnection with the grid, and energy storage. If no storage is available, the decision is simple: if the generation is larger than our demand, we sell to the grid. Otherwise, we need to buy from the grid. However, when storage is present, the decision is more complex. Should we store the energy for future usage? Or maybe tomorrow, we will have a large surplus of energy that allows us to use the energy today, at a time when the price is high. When is the best time to sell, store, or use solar energy?

Additionally, in many industries, and in particular those with hazardous environments, fleet control must satisfy a wide range of security restrictions to ensure that risks are kept at bay and accidents are minimum. Furthermore, in these environments, any decision support tool must cope with noisy and incomplete data and give recommendations every few minutes. In this work, we present a fast and efficient decision support tool to help fleet managers oversee and control ore trucks in a mining setting. The main objective of our system is to help managers avoid collisions between ore trucks and personnel buses, one of the most critical security constraints in our case study, keeping a minimum security-distance between the two at all times. Furthermore, we develop and implement additional algorithms so that our approach can work with real-life noisy GPS data. Through the use of historical data, we also study the performance of our decision support system, validating that it works under the real-life conditions presented by the company.

The reforms established a maximum waiting time between diagnosis and treatment for a set of diseases, described as an opportunity guarantee within the reform. If the maximum waiting time is exceeded, the patient is referred to another (private) facility and receives a voucher to cover the additional expenses. This voucher is paid by the health provider that had to do the procedure, which generally is a public hospital. In general, this reform has improved the service for patients with GES pathologies at the expense of patients with non-GES pathologies. These new conditions create a complicated planning scenario for hospitals, in which the hospital's OR Manager must balance the fulfillment of these opportunity guarantees and the timely service of patients not covered by the guarantee. With the collaboration of the Instituto de Neurocirugía, in Santiago, Chile, we developed a mathematical model based on stochastic dynamic programming to schedule surgeries in order to minimize the cost of referrals to the private sector. Given the large size of the state space, we developed an heuristic to compute good solutions in reasonable time and analyzed its performance. Our experimental results, with both simulated and real data, show that our algorithm performs close to optimum and improves upon the current practice. When we compared the results of our heuristic against those obtained by the hospital's OR manager in a simulation setting with real data, we reduced the overtime from occurring 21% of the time to zero, and the non-GES average waiting list's length from 71 to 58 patients, without worsening the average throughput.","tags":["hospital management","operating room scheduling","scheduling"],"title":"Operating room scheduling under waiting time constraints: the Chilean GES plan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony D.

However, when the complexity scale of the observatories increases, along with the construction and operational costs, the scheduling optimization becomes a key subject. Experience has shown that small optimization improvements translate into a significant efficiency gain, measured by an increase in the scientific return and diminishing operational costs. When entering an era of big ground based observatories the scheduling problem becomes essential. The scheduling optimization requires a multidisciplinary approach involving the fields of engineering, computer science, data analysis, operations research, and mathematical modeling. It is studied from both a methodological standpoint as well as its applications in different fields and industries. Due to such multidisciplinarity, ADASS is an excellent meeting and exchange point to gather the different communities working on the optimization problem, with a special focus on astronomical scheduling. This 'Birds of a Feather' session focused on the scheduling problem definition and solution approaches. The discussion is timely since we are at a point where instruments like ALMA (in the ADASS host country) recently started steady state operations while other big observatories such as SKA or CTA or LSST are currently at designing stage, and are actively developing new optimal scheduling systems. The aim of this meeting was to promote the building of a collaboration network between groups in different projects and disciplines in order to make the most out of the synergies among them. Such network will lead to the creation of joint research opportunities and efforts.","tags":["observatory operations","scheduling"],"title":"Astronomical Scheduling in the Era of Big Observatories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A Carrasco","Ioannis Akrotirianakis","Amit Chakraborty"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b45aafc52550594756c090604fa55b0b","permalink":"https://www.raxlab.science/publication/carrasco-2014-eupatent-1/","publishdate":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/carrasco-2014-eupatent-1/","section":"publication","summary":"Method for controlling flow of energy in smart electrical power network, involves controlling energy consumption of user based on optimal load shedding profile, optimal billing structure, and optimal load shifting profile.","tags":["demand management","energy management","game theory"],"title":"Demand shaping in an electrical power grid","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianluca Baselli","Felipe Contreras","Matías Lillo","Magdalena Marín","Rodrigo A.

In most cases, fires consumed only the tree's bark, leaving the rest of the tree with some commercial value that could be captured. The problem of deciding what actions to take with the remaining forest in this setting is known as the salvage logging problem. In this work, we present a novel mixed-integer optimization model, that can help small and medium-sized forestries make better decisions in this setting, at an operational level. Our approach helps to build a program considering the operational-level harvesting schedule, workforce allocation, and financial actions that include the insurance claims. The objective is to improve the company's cash position by the end of the harvest, without reducing the workforce. We compare our model's performance with current decisions made by medium and small forestry companies and apply it to the specific case of a company located in Cauquenes, Chile.","tags":["forestry","operations research","resource allocation","resource management","scheduling"],"title":"Salvage logging: harvest scheduling and personnel assignment after wildfires","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A.

Our algorithm handles general job-dependent resource cost functions. We also analyze the practical performance of our algorithms, showing that it is significantly superior to the theoretical bounds and in fact it is very close to optimal.

The exampleSite folder contains an example config file and content to help you get started.\n cp -av themes/academic/exampleSite/* .    Start the Hugo server from your website root folder:\n hugo server  Now you can go to localhost:1313 and your new Academic powered website should appear.\n  Customize your website - refer to the Getting Started section below\n  Build your site by running the hugo command. Then host it for free using Github Pages. Or alternatively, copy the generated public/ directory (by FTP, Rsync, etc.) to your production web server (such as your university\u0026rsquo;s hosting service).\n  Getting Started Assuming you created a new website with the example content following the installation steps above, this section explores just a few more steps in order to customize it.\nCore parameters The core parameters for the website can be edited in the config.toml configuration file:\n Set baseurl to your website URL (we recommend GitHub Pages for free hosting) Set title to your desired website title such as your name The example Disqus commenting variable should be cleared (e.g. disqusShortname = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) or set to your own Disqus shortname to enable commenting Edit your details under [params]; these will be displayed mainly in the homepage about and contact widgets (if used). To disable a contact field, simply clear the value to \u0026quot;\u0026quot;. Place a square cropped portrait photo named portrait.jpg into the static/img/ folder, overwriting any defaults. Note that you can edit the avatar filepath to point to a different image name or clear the value to disable the avatar feature. Alternatively, set gravatar to true to use the Gravatar/Wordpress avatar associated with your email address. To enable LaTeX math for your site, set math = true Social/academic networking links are defined as multiples of [[params.social]]. They can be created or deleted as necessary.  Introduce yourself Edit your biography in the about widget content/home/about.md that you copied across from the themes/academic/exampleSite/ folder. The research interests and qualifications are stored as interests and education variables. The academic qualifications are defined as multiples of [[education.courses]] and can be created or deleted as necessary. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to completely hide the interests and education lists by deleting their respective variables.\nCustomize the homepage Refer to our guide on using widgets to customize your homepage.\nAdd your content Refer to our guide on managing content to create your own publications, blog posts, talks, and projects.\nRemove unused widgets and pages  How to remove unused widgets and content pages.\nThemes The following color themes are available and can be set by the color_theme option in config.toml:\n   default ocean             forest coffee + playfair font             dark         The following font styles are available and can be set by the font option in config.toml:\n default (modern) classic (original Academic v1 style) playfair (serif)  Customization \u0026amp; updating Continue reading below for advanced customization tips and instructions for keeping the framework up-to-date with any improvements that become available.\nAdvanced customization It is possible to carry out many customizations without touching any files in themes/academic, making it easier to update the framework in the future.\nNavigation menu The [[menu.main]] entries towards the bottom of config.toml define the navigation links at the top of the website. They can be added or removed as desired.\nTo create a dropdown sub-menu, add identifier = \u0026quot;something\u0026quot; to the parent item and parent = \u0026quot;something\u0026quot; to the child item.\nWebsite icon Save your main icon and mobile icon as square PNG images named icon.png and apple-touch-icon.png, respectively. Place them in your root static/img/ folder.\nAnalytics To enable Google Analytics, add your tracking code in config.toml similarly to googleAnalytics = \u0026quot;UA-12345678-9\u0026quot;.\nThird party and local scripts (JS) To add a third party script, create a file named head_custom.html in a layouts/partials/ folder at the root of your website (not in the themes folder). Any HTML code added to this file will be included within your website\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lt;head\u0026gt;. Therefore, it\u0026rsquo;s suitable for adding custom metadata or third party scripts specified with the async attribute.\nWhereas for your own local scripts, you can link your local JS assets (relative to your root static/js) from your config.toml using custom_js = [\u0026quot;custom.js\u0026quot;].\nLanguage and translation The interface text (e.g. buttons) is stored in language files which are collected from Academic\u0026rsquo;s themes/academic/i18n/ folder, as well as an i18n/ folder at the root of your project.\nTo edit the interface text, copy themes/academic/i18n/en.yaml to i18n/en.yaml (relative to the root of your website). Open the new file and make any desired changes to the text appearing after translation:. Note that the language files are formatted in YAML syntax.\nTo translate the interface text to another language, follow the above instructions, but name the new file in the form i18n/X.yaml where X is the appropriate ISO/RFC5646 language identifier for the translation. Then follow the brief instructions in the Language section at the bottom of your config.toml. To change the default language used by Academic, set defaultContentLanguage to the desired language identifier in your configuration file.\nTo translate the navigation bar, you can edit the default [[menu.main]] instances in config.toml. However, for a multilingual site, you will need to duplicate all of the [[menu.main]] instances and rename the new instances from [[menu.main]] to [[Languages.X.menu.main]], where X is the language identifier (e.g. [[Languages.zh.menu.main]] for Simplified Chinese). Thus, the navigation bar can be displayed in multiple languages.\nTo translate a content file in your content/ folder into another language, copy the file to filename.X.md where filename is your existing filename and X is the appropriate ISO/RFC5646 language identifier for the translation. Then translate the content in the new file to the specified language.\nFor further details on Hugo\u0026rsquo;s internationalization and multilingual features, refer to the associated Hugo documentation.\nPermalinks Permalinks, or permanent links, are URLs to individual pages and posts on your website. They are permanent web addresses which can be used to link to your content. Using Hugo\u0026rsquo;s permalinks option these can be easily customized. For example, the blog post URL can be changed to the form yourURL/2016/05/01/my-post-slug by adding the following near the top of your config.toml (before [params] settings):\n[permalinks] post = \u0026quot;/:year/:month/:day/:slug\u0026quot;  Where :slug defaults to the filename of the post, excluding the file extension. However, slug may be overridden on a per post basis if desired, simply by setting slug = \u0026quot;my-short-post-title\u0026quot; in your post preamble.\nExample 2: let\u0026rsquo;s consider changing the URL path of posts from post/ to blog/. First, add the following parameters right above the [params] section of your config.toml:\n[permalinks] post = \u0026quot;/blog/:slug\u0026quot;  Then add aliases = [\u0026quot;/blog/\u0026quot;] to your post archive page post/_index.md so that it can be accessed from the /blog/ URL.\nAdvanced style customization (CSS) For advanced customization of the style, you can link custom CSS assets (relative to your root static/css) from your config.toml using custom_css = [\u0026quot;custom.css\u0026quot;].\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s override some of Academic\u0026rsquo;s default styles. First, define custom_css = [\u0026quot;override.css\u0026quot;] in config.toml. Then we can create the file static/css/override.css, relative to your website root (i.e. not in the themes directory). Add your custom CSS to this file.\nUpdating Feel free to star the project on Github to help keep track of updates and check out the release notes prior to updating your site.\nBefore updating the framework, it is recommended to make a backup of your entire website directory, or at least your themes/academic directory.\nBefore updating for the first time, the remote origin repository should be renamed to upstream:\n$ cd themes/academic $ git remote rename origin upstream  To list available updates:\n$ cd themes/academic $ git fetch upstream $ git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --decorate HEAD..upstream/master  Then, update by running:\n$ git pull upstream  If you have modified files in themes/academic, git will attempt to auto-merge changes. If conflicts are reported, you will need to manually edit the files with conflicts and add them back (git add \u0026lt;filename\u0026gt;).\nIf there are any issues after updating, you may wish to compare your site with the latest example site to check if any settings changed in config.toml or the +++ frontmatter of content files.\nFeedback \u0026amp; Contributing Please use the issue tracker to let me know about any bugs or feature requests, or alternatively make a pull request.\nFor general questions about Hugo, there is a Hugo discussion forum.\nLicense Copyright 2017 George Cushen.\nReleased under the MIT license.\n","date":1461124800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504407600,"objectID":"ba6423d815d4f5949b7a69912feb741d","permalink":"https://www.raxlab.science/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"Create a beautifully simple personal or academic website in under 10 minutes. \n","tags":["academic","hugo"],"title":"Getting started with the Academic framework for Hugo","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Homepage widgets display as sections on the homepage.

They can be found in the preamble/frontmatter (between the pair of +++) for each widget installed in the content/home/ folder.\n By default, publications will be displayed in a simple list. If you prefer a more detailed list with abstract and image, you can enable the detailed publication list on the homepage by setting list_format = 2 in content/home/publications.md.   Add a widget to the homepage To add a widget manually, copy the relevant widget from themes/academic/exampleSite/content/home/ to your content/home/ folder.\nWidget identifiers are set to their respective filenames, so a content/home/about.md widget can be linked from the navigation bar by setting the relevant URL as \u0026quot;#about\u0026quot; in config.toml.\nThis means that if you want to use multiple instances of a widget, each widget will be assigned a unique ID based on the filename that you set. You can then use that ID for linking, like in the above example.\nUsing the custom widget You can use the custom widget to create your own home page sections.\nSimply duplicate (copy/paste) and rename the example teaching file at content/home/teaching.md. Then edit the section title, weight (refer to Ordering sections below), and content as desired.\nYou may also wish to add a navigation link to the top of the page that points to the new section. This can be achieved by adding something similar to the following lines to your config.toml, where the URL will consist of the first title word in lowercase:\n[[menu.main]] name = \u0026quot;Research\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;#research\u0026quot; weight = 10  Remove a widget from the homepage If you do not require a particular widget, you can simply delete any associated files from the content/home/ folder.\nTo remove a navigation link from the top of the page, remove the associated [[menu.main]] entry in config.toml.\nOrdering widgets The order that the homepage widgets are displayed in is defined by the weight parameter in each of the files in the content/home/ directory.

Content can include publications, projects, talks, news/blog articles, and widget pages. After you have read this guide about creating and managing content, you may also be interested to learn about writing content with Markdown, LaTeX, and Shortcodes.\nTo enable LaTeX math rendering for a page, you should include math = true in the page\u0026rsquo;s +++ preamble, as demonstrated in the included example site. Otherwise, to enable math on the homepage or for all pages, you must globally set math = true in config.toml.\nTo disable source code highlighting by default for all pages, set highlight = false in config.toml. You can then enable source code highlighting only on pages that need it by setting highlight = true in that page\u0026rsquo;s preamble. See the code-highlighting docs for more details.\nTo display a featured image in content page headers, the parameters below can be inserted towards the end of a page\u0026rsquo;s +++ preamble. It is assumed that the image is located in your static/img/ folder, so the full path in the example below will be static/img/headers/getting-started.png. The caption parameter can be used to write an image caption or credit.\n[header] image = \u0026quot;headers/getting-started.png\u0026quot; caption = \u0026quot;Image credit: [**Academic**](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/)\u0026quot;   If you wish to prevent a featured image automatically being used for a post\u0026rsquo;s thumbnail on the homepage, the preview = false parameter can be added to [header].   Table of Contents  Create a publication Create a blog post Create a project Create a talk Create a widget page Create other pages (e.g. CV) Manage archive pages Removing content View your updated site Deploy your site   Create a publication To create a new publication:\nhugo new publication/my-paper-name.md  Then edit the default variables at the top of content/publication/my-paper-name.md to include the details of your publication. The url_ variables are used to generate links associated with your publication, such as for viewing PDFs of papers. Here is an example:\n+++ title = \u0026quot;A publication title, such as title of a paper\u0026quot; # Date first published. date = \u0026quot;2013-07-01\u0026quot; # Authors.

You may use *Markdown* for italics etc.\u0026quot; publication_short = \u0026quot;In *ICA*\u0026quot; # Abstract and optional shortened version. abstract = \u0026quot;The abstract. Markdown and math can be used (note that math may require escaping as detailed in the red alert box below).\u0026quot; abstract_short = \u0026quot;A short version of the abstract.\u0026quot; # Featured image thumbnail (optional) image_preview = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; # Is this a selected publication?

[header] image = \u0026quot;headers/bubbles-wide.jpg\u0026quot; caption = \u0026quot;My caption 😄\u0026quot; +++ Further details on your publication can be written here using *Markdown* for formatting. This text will be displayed on the Publication Detail page.  The url_ links can either point to local or web content. Associated local publication content, such as PDFs, may be copied to a static/pdf/ folder and referenced like url_pdf = \u0026quot;pdf/my-paper-name.pdf\u0026quot;.\nYou can also associate custom link buttons with the publication by adding the following block within the variable preamble above, which is denoted by +++:\nurl_custom = [{name = \u0026quot;Custom Link 1\u0026quot;, url = \u0026quot;http://example.org\u0026quot;}, {name = \u0026quot;Custom Link 2\u0026quot;, url = \u0026quot;http://example.org\u0026quot;}]  If you set list_format=2 to enable a detailed listing of publications in the Publication Widget (home/publications.md) or Publication Archive (publication/_index.md), then there are a few more optional variables that you can include in the publication page preamble. You may use abstract_short = \u0026quot;friendly summary of abstract\u0026quot; and publication_short = \u0026quot;abbreviated publication details\u0026quot; to display a friendly summary of the abstract and abbreviate the publication details, respectively. Furthermore, there is the option to display a different image on the homepage to the publication detail page by setting image_preview = \u0026quot;my-image.jpg\u0026quot;. This can be useful if you wish to scale down the image for the homepage or simply if you just wish to show a different image for the preview.\n Any double quotes (\u0026quot;) or backslashes (e.g. LaTeX \\times) occurring within the value of any frontmatter parameter (such as the abstract) should be escaped with a backslash (\\). For example, the symbol \u0026quot; and LaTeX text \\times become \\\u0026quot; and \\\\times, respectively. Refer to the TOML documentation for more info.   Create a blog post To create a blog/news article:\nhugo new post/my-article-name.md  Then edit the newly created file content/post/my-article-name.md with your full title and content.\nHugo will automatically generate summaries of posts that appear on the homepage. If you are dissatisfied with an automated summary, you can either limit the summary length by appropriately placing \u0026lt;!--more--\u0026gt; in the article body, or completely override the automated summary by adding a summary parameter to the +++ preamble such that:\nsummary = \u0026quot;Summary of my post.\u0026quot;  To disable commenting for a specific post, you can add disable_comments = true to the post +++ preamble. Or to disable commenting for all posts, you can either set disqusShortname = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; or disable_comments = true in config.toml.\nCreate a project To create a project:\nhugo new project/my-project-name.md  Then edit the newly created file content/project/my-project-name.md. Either you can link the project to an external project website by setting the external_link = \u0026quot;http://external-project.com\u0026quot; variable at the top of the file, or you can add content (below the final +++) in order to render a project page on your website.\nCreate a talk To create a talk:\nhugo new talk/my-talk-name.md  Then edit the newly created file content/talk/my-talk-name.md with your full talk title and details. Note that many of the talk parameters are similar to the publication parameters.\nCreate a widget page So you would like to create a page which utilizes Academic\u0026rsquo;s widget system, similar to the homepage?\nCreate a new folder in your content folder, naming it with your new page name. In this example, we will create a courses page by creating a content/courses/ folder.\nWithin your new content/courses/ folder, create a file named _index.md containing the following parameters:\n+++ title = \u0026quot;Courses\u0026quot; date = 2017-01-01 widgets = true +++  Install widgets into your content/courses/ folder. To achieve this, widgets can be copied from your content/home/ folder or downloaded from Github.\nCreate other pages (e.g. CV) For other types of content, it is possible to create your own custom pages. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s create a cv.md page for your Curriculum Vitae in your content folder. Copy across the frontmatter from the top of one of your post files, adapting it as necessary, and editing your Markdown content below. You can then link to your new page by adding the code [My CV]{{\u0026lt; ref \u0026quot;cv.md\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} to any of your existing content.\nAlternatively, for the above example, we could use a PDF of your Curriculum Vitae. For this purpose, create a folder called files within your static folder and move a PDF file named cv.pdf to that location, so we have a static/files/cv.pdf file path. The PDF can then be linked to from any content by using the code: {{% staticref \u0026quot;files/cv.pdf\u0026quot; %}}Download my CV{{% /staticref %}}.\nManage archive pages The archive (or node index) pages (e.g. /post/) are the special pages which list all of your content. They can exist for blog posts, publications, and talks. The homepage widgets will automatically link to the archive pages when you have more items of content than can be displayed in the widget. Therefore, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have much content, you may not see the automatic links yet - but you can also manually link to them using a normal Markdown formatted link in your content.\nYou can edit the title and add your own content, such as an introduction, by copying the following content _index.md files from the example site to the same structure within your content/ folder:\n/themes/academic/exampleSite/content/post/_index.md /themes/academic/exampleSite/content/publication/_index.md /themes/academic/exampleSite/content/talk/_index.md  Then edit the title parameter in each _index.md as desired and add any content after the +++ preamble/frontmatter ends. You will notice that the _index.md files differ slightly, with some having special options available for the associated content type. For example, publication/_index.md contains an option for setting the citation style of the listings which appear on the publication archive page.\nRemoving content Generally, to remove content, simply delete the relevant file from your content/post, content/publication, content/project, or content/talk folder.\nView your updated site After you have made changes to your site, you can view it by running the hugo server command and then opening localhost:1313 in your web browser.\nDeploy your site Finally, you can build the static website to a public/ folder ready for deployment using the hugo command.\nYou may then deploy your site by copying the public/ directory (by FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Rsync, git push, etc.) to your production web server.\nNote that running hugo does not remove any previously generated files before building. Therefore, it\u0026rsquo;s best practice to delete your public/ directory prior to running hugo to ensure no old or interim files are deployed to your server.\n","date":1460952000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1460952000,"objectID":"70a08859314cba3ac79d2c0c856d1fcd","permalink":"https://www.raxlab.science/post/managing-content/","publishdate":"2016-04-18T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/managing-content/","section":"post","summary":"This is a brief guide to managing content with the Academic framework.

This is a blockquote.\n Footnotes I have more [^1] to say. [^1]: Footnote example.  I have more 1 to say.\nCode highlighting Pass the language of the code, such as python, as a parameter after three backticks:\n```python # Example of code highlighting input_string_var = input(\u0026quot;Enter some data: \u0026quot;) print(\u0026quot;You entered: {}\u0026quot;.format(input_string_var)) ```  Result:\n# Example of code highlighting input_string_var = input(\u0026quot;Enter some data: \u0026quot;) print(\u0026quot;You entered: {}\u0026quot;.format(input_string_var))  Highlighting options The Academic theme uses highlight.js for source code highlighting, and highlighting is enabled by default for all pages. However, several configuration options are supported that allow finer-grained control over highlight.js.\nThe following table lists the supported options for configuring highlight.js, along with their expected type and a short description. A \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; in the config.toml column means the value can be set globally in config.toml, and a \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; in the preamble column means that the value can be set locally in a particular page\u0026rsquo;s preamble.\n   option type description config.toml preamble     highlight boolean enable/disable highlighting yes yes   highlight_languages slice choose additional languages yes yes   highlight_style string choose a highlighting style yes no    Option highlight The highlight option allows enabling or disabling the inclusion of highlight.js, either globally or for a particular page. If the option is unset, it has the same effect as if you had specified highlight = true. That is, the highlight.js javascript and css files will be included in every page. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to only include highlight.js files on pages that actually require source code highlighting, you can set highlight = false in config.toml, and then override it by setting highlight = true in the preamble of any pages that require source code highlighting. Conversely, you could enable highlighting globally, and disable it locally for pages that do not require it. Here is a table that shows whether highlighting will be enabled for a page, based on the values of highlight set in config.toml and/or the page\u0026rsquo;s preamble.\n   config.toml page preamble highlighting enabled for page?     unset or true unset or true yes   unset or true false no   false unset or false no   false true yes    Option highlight_languages The highlight_languages option allows you to specify additional languages that are supported by highlight.js, but are not considered \u0026ldquo;common\u0026rdquo; and therefore are not supported by default. For example, if you want source code highlighting for Go and clojure in all pages, set highlight_languages = [\u0026quot;go\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;clojure\u0026quot;] in config.toml. If, on the other hand, you want to enable a language only for a specific page, you can set highlight_languages in that page\u0026rsquo;s preamble.\nThe highlight_languages options specified in config.toml and in a page\u0026rsquo;s preamble are additive. That is, if config.toml contains, highlight_languages = [\u0026quot;go\u0026quot;] and the page\u0026rsquo;s preamble contains highlight_languages = [\u0026quot;ocaml\u0026quot;], then javascript files for both go and ocaml will be included for that page.\nIf the highlight_languages option is set, then the corresponding javascript files will be served from the cdnjs server. To see a list of available languages, visit the cdnjs page and search for links with the word \u0026ldquo;languages\u0026rdquo;.\nThe highlight_languages option provides an easy and convenient way to include support for additional languages to be severed from a CDN. If serving unmodified files from cdnjs doesn\u0026rsquo;t meet your needs, you can include javascript files for additional language support via one of the methods described in the getting started guide.\nOption highlight_style The highlight_style option allows you to select an alternate css style for highlighted code. For example, if you wanted to use the solarized-dark style, you could set highlight_style = \u0026quot;solarized-dark\u0026quot; in config.toml.\nIf the highlight_style option is unset, the default is to use the file /css/highlight.min.css, either the one provided by the Academic theme, or else the one in your local static directory. The /css/highlight.min.css file provided by Academic is equivalent to the github style from highlight.js.\nIf the highlight_style option is set, then /css/highlight.min.css is ignored, and the corresponding css file will be served from the cdnjs server. To see a list of available styles, visit the cdnjs page and search for links with the word \u0026ldquo;styles\u0026rdquo;.\nSee the highlight.js demo page for examples of available styles.\n Not all styles listed on the highlight.js demo page are available from the cdnjs server. If you want to use a style that is not served by cdnjs, just leave highlight_style unset, and place the corresponding css file in /static/css/highlight.min.css.    If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to change the default style that ships with Academic but you do want the style file served from the cdnjs server, set highlight_style = \u0026quot;github\u0026quot; in config.toml.   The highlight_style option is only recognized when set in config.toml. Setting highlight_style in your page\u0026rsquo;s preamble has no effect.\nTwitter tweet To include a single tweet, pass the tweet’s ID from the tweet\u0026rsquo;s URL as parameter to the shortcode:\n{{\u0026lt; tweet 666616452582129664 \u0026gt;}}  Youtube {{\u0026lt; youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc \u0026gt;}}  Vimeo {{\u0026lt; vimeo 146022717 \u0026gt;}}  GitHub gist {{\u0026lt; gist USERNAME GIST-ID \u0026gt;}}  Speaker Deck {{\u0026lt; speakerdeck 4e8126e72d853c0060001f97 \u0026gt;}}  $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math $$\\left [ – \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + V \\right ] \\Psi = i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\Psi$$  $$\\left [ – \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + V \\right ] \\Psi = i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\Psi$$\nAlternatively, inline math can be written by wrapping the formula with only a single $:\nThis is inline: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol\\beta + \\boldsymbol\\varepsilon$  This is inline: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol\\beta + \\boldsymbol\\varepsilon$\nNote that Markdown special characters need to be escaped with a backslash so they are treated as math rather than Markdown. For example, * and _ become \\* and \\_ respectively.\nMultiline equations The standard LaTeX line break consisting of 2 backslashes needs to be replaced with 6 backslashes:\n$$f(k;p\\_0^\\*) = \\begin{cases} p\\_0^\\* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1-p\\_0^\\* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  $$f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\n1-p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nPublication abstracts As Hugo and Academic attempt to parse TOML, Markdown, and LaTeX content in the abstract, the following guidelines should be followed just for the publication abstract and abstract_short fields:\n escape each LaTeX backslash (\\) with an extra backslash, yielding \\\\ escape each LaTeX underscore (_) with two backslashes, yielding \\\\_  Hence, abstract = \u0026quot;${O(d_{\\max})}$\u0026quot; becomes abstract = \u0026quot;${O(d\\\\_{\\\\max})}$\u0026quot;.\nTable Code:\n| Command | Description | | ------------------| ------------------------------ | | `hugo` | Build your website. | | `hugo serve -w` | View your website. |  Result:\n   Command Description     hugo Build your website.   hugo serve -w View your website.

This implies that any increment in their reliability will also improve their benefits. One way to achieve this is by adding redundant elements to the robot, but this adds complexity and cost to the design. On the other hand, cooperative mobile robots formed by members with the same basic structure provide a natural redundancy of elements, which may be used for reliability improvement. This work presents an architecture that takes advantage of the analytical and sensor redundancy present in groups of cooperative mobile robots in order to increase the reliability of the whole system. First, the design of the architecture is portrayed and the faults to be detected are described. The different layers of the system are then explained and analyzed using several simulations to test their capabilities and limitations.

Due to the benefits that these systems bring and the complexity of the environments where they are used, it is necessary to improve their reliability, which can be done by adding fault detection systems that are capable of diagnosing the operating state of the robot and react according to it. This thesis centers on the problem of failures on cooperative mobile robots, by designing a new low-cost architecture of fault detection and diagnosis, which is later implemented. This system allows both the control structure and the operators of the robot, to take into account the actual operating state of the mobile robot, by giving more information to them. The architecture is first evaluated using a simulation platform in MATLAB, which also helps to analyze the performance of the system. Then, the fault detection and diagnosis system is implemented on a cooperative group of small and resource-limited mobile robots, showing an excellent performance in the identification of the different faults.","tags":["control systems","fault detection","fault diagnosis","mobile robots","robotics"],"title":"Detección y diagnóstico de fallas en robots móviles cooperativos","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rodrigo A.

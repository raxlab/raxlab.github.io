      <title>Radio Interview: Managing Cancer Patient Pathways through Data</title>
      <link>https://www.raxlab.science/talk/250728-biobio/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With &lt;strong&gt;José Peña&lt;/strong&gt; we were interviewed on &lt;strong&gt;Radio BioBio&lt;/strong&gt; to discuss our research on oncology patient management, carried out in collaboration with &lt;strong&gt;José Peña&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jocelyn Dunstan&lt;/strong&gt;. The conversation focused on how many cancer patients in Chile face fragmented care and long delays, and how we can use data science, natural language processing, and optimization tools to support more equitable and timely care pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We emphasized that patients should not have to navigate complex systems alone—and that we can use algorithmic tools not to replace human judgment, but to strengthen it. As I said during the interview: &lt;em&gt;“The goal is to put intelligence at the service of life.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advancing Research through Integrated Scientific and Operational Data Management and Governance</title>
      <link>https://www.raxlab.science/talk/250618-pasc/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientific field stations generate vast amounts of data, ranging from environmental measurements to operational logistics. However, the lack of structured data governance and integration strategies often hinders the full potential of these datasets, limiting their impact on research and decision-making. At Universidad Católica, we are developing a data platform designed to streamline the management, sharing, and utilization of scientific and operational data across the Regional Field Stations Network (RCER). This platform aims to provide researchers with reliable, well-organized, and accessible data by implementing robust governance models, standardized storage structures, and seamless cloud integration. By bridging scientific and operational data streams, we enhance reproducibility, data-driven decision-making, and interdisciplinary collaboration. A key component of this effort involves the development of local data management strategies that ensure field stations can efficiently capture and process their data before integrating with the broader system. In this presentation, we will discuss the challenges of scientific data governance in distributed field environments, the methodologies we are employing to create a scalable and sustainable data infrastructure, and the expected impact on research output. Through this initiative, we aim to empower scientists by unlocking the full potential of the data they generate, ultimately advancing research across multiple disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Joining prediction and optimization: prescriptive scenario generation for energy management with storage </title>
      <link>https://www.raxlab.science/talk/250325-heidelberg/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;strong&gt;1st Heidelberg–Chile Workshop on Scientific Computing&lt;/strong&gt;, I presented our research on prescriptive scenario generation for energy management in microgrids with renewable generation and battery storage. The talk focused on bridging the gap between prediction and optimization by integrating forecasting methods and scenario-based stochastic programming into a unified decision-making framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explored techniques for generating decision-aware scenarios using adaptive partitioning methods and highlighted the shift from a “predict-then-optimize” approach to a “predict-and-optimize” paradigm. Results from simulation studies in residential microgrids demonstrated significant gains in operational efficiency compared to conventional control strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is part of the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raxlab.science/project/fondef2020gema/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GEMA project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, funded by FONDEF, and involves collaboration with colleagues and students across several institutions. The methods developed are currently being tested in real-world pilot implementations and cloud-based energy platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 12, 2025, I published an opinion piece in &lt;em&gt;El País&lt;/em&gt; titled &lt;em&gt;“When Time Is Life: Innovation for Oncology Waiting Lists in Chile.”&lt;/em&gt; The article discusses how data-driven innovation can transform oncology waitlist management, reducing delays and improving access to timely care. It highlights key strategies—such as digitalization, automation, and optimization—to enhance both efficiency and equity in the Chilean healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ClimateDL: Forecasting of extreme temperature events</title>
      <link>https://www.raxlab.science/project/climat2022/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 22:22:24 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.raxlab.science/project/climat2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forecasting extreme seasonal temperature events is especially relevant to society and its ecosystem due to their potentially dangerous impacts. Despite the above, the study of this problem is still very nascent in South America, where most of the methods proposed in the literature correspond to process-based dynamic models and classical statistical methods. Increasing the accuracy of predicting the probability of occurrence of extreme temperatures at the seasonal scale would have huge impacts on our economic life (food production, energy consumption), health, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovative approaches are emerging in climate forecasting, using network science and machine learning methodologies. The complex interrelations between temporal and spatial variables in climate time series justify the use of climate networks as an underlying automatic model explanation of the complex physical processes involved. The use of machine learning methods, particularly deep learning architectures, is justified by their success in several forecasting problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, we will evaluate the precision of the most prominent deep-learning architectures for our forecasting problem, particularly those implementing spatiotemporal models based on graphs (climate networks). The most promising antecedents for this methodology are several works based on climate networks and the effect of “El Niño” on similar forecasting problems. We expect to propose improvements to these deep learning architectures to increase their precision in our particular problems. For example, changing the scale of nodes, changing the similarity of edges, proposing new architectures that include multiple networks, training the model with augmented data, etc. We will implement and compare the results with classical statistical methods, such as principal component regression technique and Wavelet transform-based methods, among others. Assuming we achieve good predictive quality, we will evaluate the impact of these predictions on some human activities. We will focus on risk analysis of specific infrastructures (telecommunication networks, energy distribution) and on concrete case studies in situations where the considered extreme events have a strong negative impact and for which historical data are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is funded by grant 22-CLIMAT-02 (AMSUD210012) from ANID.&lt;/p&gt;

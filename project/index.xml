      <title>Operations Research Tools Applied to Scheduling in Observatory Operations </title>
      <link>https://www.raxlab.science/project/obervatoryops/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem of scheduling operations in astronomical observatories has been tackled in many different ad-hoc ways. Although it is a central task in an observatory’s operation, which affects the utilization and throughput of observations, extensive manual intervention is still required in almost all observatories. Little resources have been invested in optimizing the scheduling’s efficiency, which, in the case of large-scale observatories like ALMA or VLT, might result in significant cost-effective improvements. This issue gains importance since observatory operations have increased in complexity, with plenty of sources of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue has a lot in common with problems typically found in other industries. Here, operations research tools have been used to develop solutions for many related problems: from scheduling production plans to routing delivery vehicles. These tools and methodologies have been a source of efficiency, allowing organizations to do more with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project is to connect these two worlds, kickstarting and fostering interdisciplinary research between operations research and astronomy operations, by tackling one of the most relevant problems: optimal scheduling of operations. The focus will be to develop and apply operations research tools to construct decision support systems that can help managers improve efficiency and utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is funded by grant ASTRO20-0058 from ANID and by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Radio Telescope.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OSoM: Optimal Storage Management for Variable Generation</title>
      <link>https://www.raxlab.science/project/energymanagement/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the exciting topics we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on is algorithms and models related to energy management, where uncertainty is a crucial element in the process. In particular, our focus is currently on building decision support tools for optimal storage management when a variable and intermittent source of energy is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project combines machine learning methodologies and stochastic optimization tools to develop optimal energy management systems for a system with photovoltaic generation, interconnection with the grid, and energy storage. If no storage is available, the decision is simple: if generation is larger than our demand, we sell to the grid. Otherwise, we need to buy from the grid. When storage is present, the decision is not as straightforward. Should we store the energy for future usage? Or maybe tomorrow we will have a large surplus of energy that allows us to use the energy today, at a time when the price is high. When is the best time to sell, store or use solar energy? We answer these questions through our research project by developing a prototype that implements the optimal decisions defined by our mathematical optimization models and measuring this approach&amp;rsquo;s benefits compared to today&amp;rsquo;s standard storage policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is funded by FONDEF ID19I10158 grant from ANID y has cloud resources thanks to the AWS Cloud Credit for Research program.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Predictive Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://www.raxlab.science/project/faultdetection/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are developing tools to detect and diagnose faults in an automatic fashion. Using machine learning and mathematical modeling techniques, we are developing algorithms to help in online deteccion of faults at the ALMA Radiotelescope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is partially funded by FIE-2016-V022 and 16IFI6626 CORFO Grants.&lt;/p&gt;

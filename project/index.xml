      <title>SAVIIA: Trusted Data Infrastructures for Field Science</title>
      <link>https://www.raxlab.science/project/saviia2025/</link>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    From data capture to decision: SAVIIA links local orchestration with cloud pipelines and governance so that field data can be trusted, reused, and scaled.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-saviia&#34;&gt;What is SAVIIA?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAVIIA&lt;/strong&gt; (Sistema de Administración y Visualización de Información para la Investigación y Análisis) is a &lt;strong&gt;trusted data infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt; for UC’s &lt;strong&gt;Regional Field Stations Network (RCER)&lt;/strong&gt;. It integrates &lt;strong&gt;scientific&lt;/strong&gt; (sensors, surveys, imagery) and &lt;strong&gt;operational&lt;/strong&gt; data (logistics, maintenance, safety) through a common governance model and &lt;strong&gt;hybrid local–cloud&lt;/strong&gt; architecture, enabling &lt;strong&gt;reproducible pipelines&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;auditable analyses&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;secure sharing&lt;/strong&gt; across teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-it-matters&#34;&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field research suffers from fragmented sources, intermittent connectivity, and uneven practices. SAVIIA addresses this by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standardizing&lt;/strong&gt; capture, metadata, and storage so datasets are &lt;strong&gt;FAIR&lt;/strong&gt; (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bridging&lt;/strong&gt; local constraints and cloud-scale analytics to support &lt;strong&gt;continuous, trustworthy&lt;/strong&gt; workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting&lt;/strong&gt; scientific and operational streams to improve &lt;strong&gt;data quality, reproducibility&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;decision-making&lt;/strong&gt; in stations and partner projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;architecture-at-a-glance&#34;&gt;Architecture at a glance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Orchestrator:&lt;/strong&gt; edge services for device/sensor ingestion, validation, caching, and scheduled exports; resilient to low/unstable connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; versioned data lake + workflow engine for ETL/ELT, quality checks, and lineage; analytical sandboxes for teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Models &amp;amp; Views:&lt;/strong&gt; curated datasets, dashboards, and APIs for research, station operations, and stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-governance&#34;&gt;Data governance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAVIIA implements lightweight, enforceable rules centered on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality:&lt;/strong&gt; schema checks, unit validation, completeness, timeliness SLAs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traceability:&lt;/strong&gt; dataset identifiers, provenance, code–data–result linkage; reproducible notebooks/pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access &amp;amp; Sharing:&lt;/strong&gt; roles, project spaces, embargo/visibility policies; clear licensing for reuse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety &amp;amp; Ethics:&lt;/strong&gt; consent/acceptable-use registers; minimal exposure for sensitive fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-were-building-deliverables&#34;&gt;What we’re building (deliverables)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAVIIA Local&lt;/strong&gt;: deployable edge stack (ingestion, validation, scheduling, secure sync).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAVIIA Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;: data lake + workflow templates; metadata registry; dataset catalogue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operations Kit&lt;/strong&gt;: runbooks, templates, QA playbooks, and “hello-station” examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualization &amp;amp; APIs&lt;/strong&gt;: curated views and endpoints for research and station management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training &amp;amp; Onboarding&lt;/strong&gt;: short guides for station staff and researchers; governance checklists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAVIIA advances the state of practice by &lt;strong&gt;operationalizing governance&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;linking edge capture with cloud analytics&lt;/strong&gt;, so field science can move from isolated datasets to &lt;strong&gt;reliable, decision-ready&lt;/strong&gt; evidence at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PLASMA: Analytical Platform for Maintenance Systems</title>
      <link>https://www.raxlab.science/project/fondef2024plasma/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2024 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.raxlab.science/project/fondef2024plasma/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The PLASMA project aims to enhance maintenance management in industrial settings by developing a cloud-based analytical platform that integrates advanced predictive and prescriptive algorithms. Initially designed for use in complex systems like the ALMA Radiotelescope, these algorithms will now be adapted and validated for broader industrial applications. The platform’s core focus is to predict equipment degradation and remaining useful life (RUL), allowing maintenance teams to preemptively address issues and optimize resource allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Viña Concha y Toro, PLASMA will deploy its algorithms within bottling and packaging lines to minimize operational disruptions and reduce the costs associated with equipment downtime. The project involves a comprehensive analysis of sensor data and production metrics to calibrate the predictive models for accuracy in real-world scenarios. Alongside prediction capabilities, the platform will also support decision-making through stochastic optimization models that balance maintenance costs with equipment reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project’s end goal is a scalable, cloud-based platform capable of managing predictive maintenance across diverse industrial sectors. With the support of technology partner Orión, PLASMA will be designed for 24/7 digital support, providing a robust solution for maintenance planning and execution. By ensuring the flexibility to adapt to various industrial contexts, the platform has the potential to generate significant value by reducing operational costs and enhancing equipment availability across sectors like viticulture, mining, and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is funded by FONDEF IT24I0031 grant from ANID, and supported by Concha y Toro and Orion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Development of Oncology Waiting List Prioritization Strategies</title>
      <link>https://www.raxlab.science/project/polpub2024onco/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.raxlab.science/project/polpub2024onco/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project focuses on improving access to cancer care in Chile by developing prioritization models for oncology waiting lists within the South Eastern Metropolitan Health Service. Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality in Chile, and the existing lack of standardized prioritization criteria has led to extensive and uneven waiting lists, particularly impacting disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. By enhancing the way oncology patients are prioritized for systemic therapies, such as chemotherapy, this project seeks to improve equity and efficiency within the public health system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our approach leverages data science and mathematical optimization to develop robust models for managing these waiting lists. The research involves a detailed mapping of current scheduling and prioritization processes for oncology treatments, which serves as the case study foundation. We will also conduct a comprehensive review of prioritization models in similar contexts to inform our methodology. Data quality assessments will allow us to identify actionable insights, and data extraction techniques will be applied to build effective decision-support tools based on available health data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this project, we aim to create a framework for dynamic prioritization that can be tailored to capacity limitations and patient needs, incorporating constraints such as guaranteed health coverage and specific cancer treatment requirements. Beyond oncology, the methodologies and models developed here hold the potential for application in other areas of healthcare, providing a scalable solution for optimizing resource allocation and patient care across diverse medical fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is funded by Políticas Públicas UC grant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Resource cost-aware scheduling problems under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://www.raxlab.science/project/fondecyt2023/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.raxlab.science/project/fondecyt2023/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our project addresses the critical balance between resource consumption and scheduling efficiency in settings where resources are limited or costly, such as astronomical observatories, manufacturing, and maintenance processes. Managing these constraints effectively can lead to substantial performance improvements but requires advanced techniques to weigh the trade-off between consuming resources and meeting scheduling demands. In many cases, resources, such as energy or workforce, are not only limited but also costly, adding an extra layer of complexity to scheduling tasks optimally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unique aspect of this research is its focus on scheduling under uncertainty, where key parameters, like job sizes or deadlines, may not be known beforehand. This complexity is particularly relevant to observatories in Chile, where variable factors such as sky quality or observation lengths affect task durations. Through collaboration with some of the largest observatories, we gain access to unique datasets and domain expertise, enabling us to test our methods in real-world scenarios. This approach also opens pathways to apply our findings in other industries that face similar scheduling and resource challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are developing a comprehensive set of prescriptive analytics tools, including new algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees and benchmarks that address these resource-cost-aware scheduling problems. Our work will involve constructing approximation algorithms using mathematical programming and resource augmentation techniques. We aim to build a publicly accessible repository of benchmark instances—using real-world data and factoring in uncertainties and various scheduling metrics—that will advance research in this field and provide robust, adaptable solutions for diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Operations Research Tools Applied to Observatory Operations </title>
      <link>https://www.raxlab.science/project/obervatoryops/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 22:22:24 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.raxlab.science/project/obervatoryops/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem of scheduling operations in astronomical observatories has been tackled in various ad-hoc ways. Although it is a central task in an observatory’s operation, which affects the utilization and throughput of observations, extensive manual intervention is still required in almost all observatories. Moreover, little resources have been invested in optimizing the scheduling’s efficiency, which, in the case of large-scale observatories like ALMA or VLT, might result in significant cost-effective improvements. This issue gains importance since observatory operations have increased in complexity, with plenty of sources of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue has a lot in common with problems typically found in other industries. Operations research tools have been used here to develop solutions for many related topics, from scheduling production plans to routing delivery vehicles. These tools and methodologies have been a source of efficiency, allowing organizations to do more with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project aims to connect these two worlds, kickstarting and fostering interdisciplinary research between operations research and astronomy operations by tackling one of the most relevant problems: optimal operations scheduling. The focus will be to develop and apply operations research tools to construct decision support systems that can help managers improve efficiency and utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is funded by grant ASTRO20-0058 from ANID and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Radio Telescope.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ClimateDL: Forecasting of extreme temperature events</title>
      <link>https://www.raxlab.science/project/climat2022/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 22:22:24 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.raxlab.science/project/climat2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forecasting extreme seasonal temperature events is especially relevant to society and its ecosystem due to their potentially dangerous impacts. Despite the above, the study of this problem is still very nascent in South America, where most of the methods proposed in the literature correspond to process-based dynamic models and classical statistical methods. Increasing the accuracy of predicting the probability of occurrence of extreme temperatures at the seasonal scale would have huge impacts on our economic life (food production, energy consumption), health, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovative approaches are emerging in climate forecasting, using network science and machine learning methodologies. The complex interrelations between temporal and spatial variables in climate time series justify the use of climate networks as an underlying automatic model explanation of the complex physical processes involved. The use of machine learning methods, particularly deep learning architectures, is justified by their success in several forecasting problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, we will evaluate the precision of the most prominent deep-learning architectures for our forecasting problem, particularly those implementing spatiotemporal models based on graphs (climate networks). The most promising antecedents for this methodology are several works based on climate networks and the effect of “El Niño” on similar forecasting problems. We expect to propose improvements to these deep learning architectures to increase their precision in our particular problems. For example, changing the scale of nodes, changing the similarity of edges, proposing new architectures that include multiple networks, training the model with augmented data, etc. We will implement and compare the results with classical statistical methods, such as principal component regression technique and Wavelet transform-based methods, among others. Assuming we achieve good predictive quality, we will evaluate the impact of these predictions on some human activities. We will focus on risk analysis of specific infrastructures (telecommunication networks, energy distribution) and on concrete case studies in situations where the considered extreme events have a strong negative impact and for which historical data are available.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GEMS: variable-Generation Energy Management with Storage</title>
      <link>https://www.raxlab.science/project/fondef2020gema/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 22:25:44 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.raxlab.science/project/fondef2020gema/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the exciting topics we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on is algorithms and models related to energy management, where uncertainty is a crucial element in the process. In particular, our focus is on building decision support tools for optimal storage management when a variable and intermittent energy source is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project combines machine learning methodologies and stochastic optimization tools to develop optimal energy management systems for a system with photovoltaic generation, interconnection with the grid, and energy storage. If no storage is available, the decision is simple: if the generation is larger than our demand, we sell to the grid. Otherwise, we need to buy from the grid. However, when storage is present, the decision is more complex. Should we store the energy for future usage? Or maybe tomorrow, we will have a large surplus of energy that allows us to use the energy today, at a time when the price is high. When is the best time to sell, store, or use solar energy? We answer these questions through our research project by developing a prototype that implements the optimal decisions defined by our mathematical optimization models and measuring this approach&amp;rsquo;s benefits compared to today&amp;rsquo;s standard storage policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is funded by FONDEF ID19I10158 grant from ANID y has cloud resources thanks to the AWS Cloud Credit for Research program.&lt;/p&gt;

Since I was little I was curious, wanting to understand how things worked and wondering how I could generate new knowledge to be able to solve real-world problems that to this day may not have a solution.

Currently, I'm a Student of the Master in Engineering Sciences at Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez and Student of BSc in Industrial Engineering.

My research interests are in combinatorial problems. I'm currently working on analyzing different methods to generate scenarios for an optimization model, showing that the resulting decision support system significantly improves current programming policies.
